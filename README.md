Işığın Yolu – Unity Gamification Project

 Unity-based educational game designed to teach **5th-grade students** the learning objectives of *light propagation* through gamified mechanics.  
The project aims to help children understand how light spreads, reflects, and interacts with objects in an engaging, interactive way.

Developed using **C#** in Unity, this project combines educational content with game design principles to enhance learning motivation and retention.






Features

\- Immersive gameplay loop centered around light mechanics and exploration  

\- Progression and reward systems designed with gamification principles  

\- C# scripts for dynamic lighting, player interactions, and scoring logic  

\- Optimized environment setup to demonstrate real-time rendering and physics
